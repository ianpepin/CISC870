# CISC870 Project

Conclave folder: contains the source code of the Conclave framework. The output of the computation for the different input sizes can be found in the "results" folder. The "protocol.py" file contains the task that is executed in the experiment. The data of each party is aggregated and the number of visits for each patient ID is calculated.

inputData folder: contains the inputs used for the experiments, a script to change the numbers to integers since the JIFF backend only processes integers, and the commands used to run the computation for the different parties. Each input folder contains the database with all records, as well as the database split in 3 files, one for each user.
